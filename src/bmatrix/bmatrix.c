/*
 * Calculate binary matrix rank.
 *
 * Parameters :
 * bmatrix - the binary matrix stored as list of 32 bits words;
 *           each element of the table represents one row; one
 *           word in the table is in big endian representation
 *           and only n bits are valid ([31..(31-n+1)]), the
 *           rest is unused.
 *
 * m - the number of rows of the bmatrix <1, 32>.
 * n - the number of columns of the bmatrix <1, 32>.
 *
 * Returns: the rank of the m x binary matrix.
